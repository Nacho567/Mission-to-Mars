# **Mission-to-Mars**
Mod 11: Web Scraping

## **Overview**

### Purpose
In this module we used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape websites and then import and analyze the data. The websites scraped were https://redplanetscience.com/ and https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html.

### Results
Using the dataset we can answer a few questions that were asked of us.

1. There are twelve months on Mars.
2. There's 1867 Martian days of data.
3. The coldest month on Mars is the third month, while the "warmest" month is the eighth.
4. The month with the lowest atmospheric pressure is the sixth month, while the highest is the ninth.
5. It appears that one Martian year is about 675 days.
